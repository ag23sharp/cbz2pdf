Yes, fighter jets typically have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots when their aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or obstacles, helping to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. In fighter jets, GPWS provides pilots with aural and visual warnings, such as "Terrain, terrain," "Pull up," or "Bank angle," when the aircraft is approaching dangerous proximity to the ground or obstacles.
