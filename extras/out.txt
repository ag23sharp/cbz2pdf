Nokia was once a leading manufacturer of mobile phones, known for their durability, reliability, and iconic designs. While their market share has declined in recent years, Nokia still maintains a strong reputation for producing quality products. Here are some reasons why Nokia was and is still considered a good brand:

**Durability:** Nokia phones have long been known for their ruggedness and ability to withstand tough conditions. They were often made with durable materials, such as polycarbonate and metal, and were designed to withstand drops, bumps, and spills.

**Reliability:** Nokia phones were also known for their reliability. They were often built with high-quality components and were rigorously tested before being released to the market. This resulted in phones that were less likely to experience software crashes or hardware failures.

**Iconic designs:** Nokia produced some of the most iconic mobile phone designs of all time. Models such as the Nokia 3310, Nokia 6600, and Nokia N95 were instantly recognizable and became symbols of the mobile phone era.

**Innovation:** Nokia was also a pioneer in mobile phone innovation. They were one of the first companies to introduce features such as the camera phone, the smartphone, and the touchscreen. They also played a major role in the development of the Symbian operating system, which was once the most popular mobile operating system in the world.

**Strong brand reputation:** Nokia has built up a strong brand reputation over many years. They are known for producing quality products that are reliable, durable, and innovative. This reputation has helped Nokia to maintain a loyal customer base even as their market share has declined.

However, it is important to note that other brands have emerged in recent years that also offer high-quality mobile phones with advanced features and sleek designs. This has led to increased competition in the mobile phone market, and Nokia has faced challenges in maintaining its market share.
