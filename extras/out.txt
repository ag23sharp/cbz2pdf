Yes, most modern fighter jets have a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that alerts pilots to the aircraft's proximity to the ground and potential obstacles, helping to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. It uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, to monitor the aircraft's height above the ground and its rate of descent. When the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it provides both aural and visual warnings to the pilot.
