Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to the pilot when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, airspeed sensors, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's altitude and proximity to the ground. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground or another obstacle, it will issue a warning to the pilot. This warning can be aural, visual, or tactile, and it will typically include information about the aircraft's altitude, airspeed, and proximity to the ground. GPWS is a critical safety system that has helped to prevent many accidents.
