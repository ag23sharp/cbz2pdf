Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a safety system designed to warn pilots when the aircraft is too close to the ground or other obstacles. It uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters and terrain databases, to determine the aircraft's altitude and proximity to the ground. When the aircraft is at risk of colliding with the ground, GPWS provides aural and visual warnings to the pilot, giving them time to take corrective action.
