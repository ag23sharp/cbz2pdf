Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a cockpit avionics system that provides warnings to the pilot when the aircraft is close to the ground or other obstacles, such as mountains or buildings. The system uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters, inertial navigation systems, and terrain databases, to determine the aircraft's position and altitude relative to the surrounding environment.

GPWS systems typically provide aural and visual warnings to the pilot, such as a voice message indicating "TOO LOW, GEAR" or "PULL UP," if the aircraft is descending too rapidly or is in danger of colliding with terrain. Some GPWS systems also include a "terrain avoidance" mode, which can automatically adjust the aircraft's flight path to avoid obstacles.

GPWS is a valuable safety feature that helps to prevent accidents involving fighter jets. By providing timely warnings to the pilot, GPWS can help to ensure that the aircraft remains at a safe altitude and clear of obstacles.
