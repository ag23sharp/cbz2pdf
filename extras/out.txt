Nokia was a very popular mobile phone brand in the early 2000s, but their market share has declined significantly in recent years. There are a number of reasons for this, including:

* **Increased competition:** The mobile phone market has become increasingly competitive in recent years, with new brands such as Apple and Samsung emerging as major players. Nokia has struggled to keep up with this competition, and has lost market share to these newer brands.
* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been criticized for its lack of innovation in recent years. The company has been slow to adopt new technologies, and has not been able to keep up with the changing needs of consumers.
* **Poor marketing:** Nokia has also been criticized for its poor marketing. The company has not been able to create a strong brand image, and has not been able to effectively communicate its value proposition to consumers.
* **Financial difficulties:** Nokia has also faced a number of financial difficulties in recent years. The company has been forced to make a number of cuts to its workforce, and has sold off a number of its assets. These financial difficulties have made it difficult for Nokia to invest in new products and marketing, which has further hampered its ability to compete.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined significantly in recent years. The company is now a relatively small player in the mobile phone market, and it is unlikely to regain its former glory.
