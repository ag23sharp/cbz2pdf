Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. 

GPWS is designed to alert pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, providing valuable information to avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. 

Fighter jets operate at high speeds and low altitudes, increasing their risk of CFIT. GPWS can help ensure pilot awareness of terrain hazards, particularly during low-visibility conditions or high-stress situations.
