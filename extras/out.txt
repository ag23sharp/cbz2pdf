Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a crucial safety feature that provides the flight crew with timely alerts and warnings about potential collisions with the ground or other obstacles during low-altitude flight. It utilizes a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters, terrain databases, and flight control data, to monitor the aircraft's position relative to the terrain and provide warnings in case of an impending hazard. By providing critical information to the pilots, GPWS helps prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents and enhances overall flight safety.
