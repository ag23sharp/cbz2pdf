Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a safety device designed to alert pilots when their aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or obstacles. It uses a combination of radar and barometric sensors to determine the aircraft's altitude and distance from the ground. If the aircraft is flying too low or is approaching an obstacle, the GPWS will activate a series of warnings to the pilot, including visual, audible, and tactile alerts. These warnings can help pilots to avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are often caused by pilot error or disorientation.
