Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a system designed to alert pilots of potential collisions with the ground or other obstacles by providing visual, aural, and tactile warnings. It uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters and terrain databases, to calculate the aircraft's position and altitude relative to the ground and surrounding terrain. When a potential hazard is detected, the GPWS provides a series of warnings, including verbal callouts, visual cues, and stick shakers, to alert the pilot and help them avoid a collision.
