Nokia is not considered to be particularly good in the current smartphone market. While they were once a dominant player in the industry, they have lost significant market share in recent years. Here are some of the reasons why Nokia is no longer considered a top player in the smartphone market:

* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been criticized for its lack of innovation in recent years. Their smartphones often lack the latest features and technology, and they have been slow to adapt to changing market trends.
* **Poor software support:** Nokia's software support has also been criticized. Their smartphones often receive updates slowly, and they have been slow to fix bugs and security issues.
* **Weak marketing:** Nokia's marketing efforts have also been weak in recent years. They have not been able to effectively communicate the value of their smartphones to consumers.
* **Strong competition:** Nokia faces strong competition from other smartphone manufacturers, such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. These companies have been more successful in innovating and marketing their smartphones, and they have a larger market share.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined in recent years. They are no longer considered a top player in the smartphone market, and their smartphones are not considered to be particularly good.
