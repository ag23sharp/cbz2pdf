Yes, many fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots when the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, water, or other obstacles. It uses radar or other sensors to measure the aircraft's altitude, airspeed, and other parameters, and provides visual and aural warnings if the aircraft is in danger of a collision. GPWS is a critical safety feature that has helped to prevent many accidents.
