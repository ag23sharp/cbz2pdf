Yes, most modern fighter jets have some form of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. These systems are designed to provide the pilot with audible and visual warnings when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, obstacles, or other potential hazards.

GPWS systems in fighter jets typically include a variety of sensors, such as radar altimeters, terrain databases, and inertial navigation systems. These sensors are used to continuously monitor the aircraft's altitude, ground speed, and position relative to the terrain. When the system detects that the aircraft is approaching a potential hazard, it will issue a warning to the pilot.

The warnings issued by GPWS systems can vary depending on the specific system and the situation. Some common warnings include:

* "Terrain, terrain, pull up!"
* "Obstacle ahead!"
* "Low altitude!"
* "Excessive closure rate!"

GPWS systems are an important safety feature in fighter jets, and they have helped to prevent numerous accidents. By providing the pilot with early warning of potential hazards, GPWS systems can give the pilot time to react and avoid a collision.
