Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). GPWS is a system designed to alert pilots when an aircraft is in close proximity to the ground. It uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to determine the aircraft's altitude and distance from the ground. GPWS can provide both audible and visual warnings to the pilots, and it can also automatically take control of the aircraft to prevent a collision with the ground.
