However, the city ordered the statue to be removed, saying it was unauthorized and posed a safety hazard.\n\nThe removal of the statue sparked outrage among some activists, who believe it is a symbol of the ongoing fight against police brutality. The NYPD said it used \"minimal force\" to remove the statue and that no one was injured."
