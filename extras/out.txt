Nokia was once a leading mobile phone manufacturer, known for its durability, reliability, and user-friendliness. Some reasons why Nokia was considered good include:

**1. Durability:** Nokia phones were renowned for their robust construction and ability to withstand harsh conditions. They were often made from tough materials like polycarbonate and stainless steel, making them resistant to drops, shocks, and water damage.

**2. Reliability:** Nokia phones were praised for their dependability and longevity. They were well-built and less prone to hardware or software issues. Users could typically rely on their Nokia phones to work consistently and without major problems for extended periods.

**3. User-friendliness:** Nokia phones were known for their intuitive user interface and simple navigation. The Symbian operating system used in many Nokia models was easy to learn and operate, even for first-time smartphone users. Features like customizable home screens and easy-to-access menus made the phones user-friendly.

**4. Battery life:** Nokia phones were famous for their long battery life. They were optimized for energy efficiency, allowing users to enjoy extended talk time and standby time on a single charge. This made them suitable for people who needed to stay connected for long periods without access to a power outlet.

**5. Classic designs:** Nokia designs, such as the "brick" phone, became iconic in the mobile phone industry. Their sleek and ergonomic shapes and classic colors appealed to a wide range of users. Nokia also introduced innovative form factors, like the slider phone and the clamshell phone, which offered unique and stylish options.

**6. Strong brand reputation:** Nokia built a strong brand reputation over the years, becoming synonymous with quality, innovation, and durability. This reputation played a significant role in the popularity and success of its phones.

However, it's worth noting that Nokia's dominance in the mobile phone market declined in the late 2000s and early 2010s due to the rise of smartphones and the increasing popularity of competitors like Apple and Samsung.
