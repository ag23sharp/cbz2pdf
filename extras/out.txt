Nokia was once a leading brand in the mobile phone industry, known for its durability, reliability, and innovative features. However, the company has since lost its market share to competitors like Apple and Samsung. Here are some of the reasons why Nokia was once considered to be a good brand:

* **Durability:** Nokia phones were renowned for their ruggedness and durability. They were often made of strong materials like polycarbonate and metal, and could withstand drops and bumps without sustaining major damage.
* **Reliability:** Nokia phones were also known for their reliability. They were generally well-built and had a long lifespan, with many users reporting that their Nokia phones lasted for several years without any major issues.
* **Innovative features:** Nokia was also a pioneer in the mobile phone industry, introducing a number of innovative features that became industry standards. For example, Nokia was the first company to introduce a phone with a built-in camera, and was also one of the first to offer a wide range of multimedia features.
* **Brand reputation:** Nokia had a strong brand reputation, and was seen as a reliable and trustworthy brand. This reputation helped the company to attract a loyal customer base, who were willing to pay a premium for Nokia phones.

However, in recent years, Nokia has lost its market share to competitors like Apple and Samsung. This is due to a number of factors, including:

* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been criticized for a lack of innovation in recent years. The company has failed to keep up with the latest trends in the mobile phone industry, and its phones have often been seen as being outdated.
* **Poor marketing:** Nokia has also been criticized for its poor marketing. The company has failed to effectively communicate the benefits of its phones to consumers, and has often been outshone by competitors in terms of marketing and advertising.
* **Strong competition:** Nokia faces strong competition from a number of other brands, including Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. These brands have been able to offer consumers more innovative and feature-rich phones at a lower price point.

As a result of these factors, Nokia has lost its market share in recent years. The company is now focusing on the low-end of the market, and is trying to regain its position by offering affordable phones with basic features.
