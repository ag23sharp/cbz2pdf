Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, obstacles, or terrain, and to provide guidance to help avoid a collision.

GPWS typically uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and terrain databases, to determine the aircraft's altitude, ground speed, and proximity to obstacles. The system can provide both audible and visual alerts to the pilots, and can also provide guidance on how to avoid a collision.

GPWS is an essential safety feature for fighter jets, as they often operate at high speeds and low altitudes. The system can help to prevent accidents caused by pilot error, such as controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.
