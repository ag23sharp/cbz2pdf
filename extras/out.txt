Nokia was once a dominant player in the mobile phone industry, but its market share has declined in recent years. There are a number of reasons for this, including:

* **Competition from other brands.** Nokia faced increasing competition from other brands, such as Samsung, Apple, and Huawei. These brands offered phones with more features and better designs than Nokia's phones.
* **Nokia's slow adoption of new technologies.** Nokia was slow to adopt new technologies, such as 4G and Android. This made its phones less appealing to consumers.
* **Nokia's focus on feature phones.** Nokia continued to focus on feature phones, even as the market shifted to smartphones. This made it difficult for Nokia to compete with other brands that were offering smartphones.
* **Nokia's lack of innovation.** Nokia failed to innovate its products in a timely manner. This made its phones less appealing to consumers.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined in recent years. However, Nokia is still a major player in the mobile phone industry, and it is possible that the company could regain its former dominance.
