No, fighter jets do not typically have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is designed to alert pilots of impending ground proximity when flying at low altitudes, particularly during landing and takeoff. Fighter jets operate at much higher altitudes and speeds than typical commercial or private aircraft, so the risk of a terrain impact is significantly lower. Additionally, fighter jets are equipped with advanced avionics and radar systems that provide pilots with detailed situational awareness, making GPWS less necessary.
