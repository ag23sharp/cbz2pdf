Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to pilots when an aircraft is in close proximity to the ground. This system uses radar, barometric, and flight control data to calculate the aircraft's altitude and distance from the ground. If the system determines that the aircraft is too close to the ground, it will issue visual and aural warnings to the pilot. GPWS has helped to prevent numerous accidents and has become a standard feature on most modern military and civilian aircraft.
