Yes, many fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that alerts pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. It uses various sensors, such as radar altimeters, to determine the aircraft's height above the ground and provides warnings to the pilot through visual and auditory cues. GPWS is a valuable tool for preventing controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are one of the leading causes of fatal aviation accidents.
