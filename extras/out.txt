Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a vital safety feature that provides pilots with alerts and warnings when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or obstacles. It helps to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are often fatal.

GPWS uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to determine the aircraft's position and altitude relative to the ground. It also takes into account the aircraft's speed, attitude, and configuration.

When GPWS detects that the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, it provides a series of audible and visual alerts to the pilots. These alerts include:

* Aural warnings, such as "Pull up!" or "Terrain ahead!"
* Visual warnings, such as a flashing "terrain" warning on the instrument panel
* Stick shakers, which vibrate the control stick to get the pilot's attention

GPWS has been credited with saving many lives by preventing CFIT accidents. It is a vital safety feature that is now standard equipment on most modern fighter jets.
