Nokia was once one of the leading manufacturers of mobile phones in the world. However, the company's market share has declined in recent years due to competition from other manufacturers. Nokia's strength was in its focus on quality over quantity. The company's phones were known to be well-built and reliable. Nokia also had a strong brand reputation. The company's logo was instantly recognizable, and its phones were seen as a status symbol. However, Nokia failed to adapt to the changing market. The company was slow to adopt new technologies, such as smartphones and touchscreen devices. As a result, Nokia lost market share to other manufacturers who were more innovative. Nokia is still a major player in the mobile phone market, but the company has lost its dominance. The company is now focused on producing mid-range and low-end phones. Nokia is also trying to revive its brand image with new products, such as the Nokia 8 Sirocco and the Nokia 7 Plus.
