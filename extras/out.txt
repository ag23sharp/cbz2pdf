Yes, many modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS systems use radar or other sensors to detect the aircraft's proximity to the ground and provide warnings to the pilot if there is a risk of collision. They are designed to help pilots avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are a major cause of aviation fatalities.
