Yes, many fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to pilots when the aircraft is in proximity to the ground or other obstacles. The system utilizes sensors such as radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and terrain databases to determine the aircraft's position and proximity to terrain. When the system detects a potential hazard, it provides audible and visual alerts to the pilots, such as "Terrain, terrain, pull up." GPWS has been credited with preventing numerous accidents and saving lives.
