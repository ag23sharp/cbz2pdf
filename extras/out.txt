Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that alerts pilots when the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground or other obstacles. It uses a variety of sensors to measure altitude, airspeed, and terrain data, and provides warnings to the pilots in the form of visual and auditory alerts. GPWS is considered an essential safety feature in modern aircraft, and is widely used in both military and civilian applications.
