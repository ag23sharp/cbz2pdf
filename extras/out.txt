Nokia was once the leading mobile phone manufacturer in the world, but its market share has declined in recent years due to competition from other brands such as Samsung, Apple, and Huawei. However, Nokia still has a number of advantages over its competitors, including:

* **Brand recognition:** Nokia is a well-established brand with a long history of innovation in the mobile phone industry. This gives Nokia a strong advantage over newer brands, as consumers are more likely to trust a company they know and recognize.
* **Durability:** Nokia phones are known for their durability and reliability. This is due in part to Nokia's use of high-quality materials and its rigorous testing process. As a result, Nokia phones are often the preferred choice for people who need a phone that can withstand tough conditions.
* **Affordability:** Nokia phones are typically more affordable than phones from other brands. This makes Nokia phones a good option for people who are on a budget.
* **Simplicity:** Nokia phones are known for their simple and easy-to-use interface. This makes Nokia phones a good option for people who are not familiar with smartphones or who prefer a more straightforward user experience.

Overall, Nokia phones offer a number of advantages over their competitors, including brand recognition, durability, affordability, and simplicity. These advantages make Nokia phones a good option for people who are looking for a reliable and affordable phone.
