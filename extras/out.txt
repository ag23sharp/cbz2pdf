Nokia is a Finnish multinational telecommunications company that was once the world's largest mobile phone manufacturer. Nokia's success was due to a number of factors, including:

* **Early market entry:** Nokia was one of the first companies to enter the mobile phone market, and it quickly established itself as a leader.
* **Strong brand recognition:** Nokia's brand was well-known and trusted by consumers, and this helped to drive sales.
* **Innovative products:** Nokia was known for its innovative products, such as the first mobile phone with a built-in camera.
* **Efficient manufacturing:** Nokia had a very efficient manufacturing process, which allowed it to produce high-quality phones at a low cost.

However, Nokia's success did not last forever. The company began to lose market share to Apple and Samsung in the early 2010s, and it eventually sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft in 2014.

Today, Nokia is a much smaller company than it was at its peak, but it is still a major player in the telecommunications industry. The company focuses on providing network infrastructure and services to telecommunications operators and other businesses.
