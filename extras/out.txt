Some fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS), while others are not. The decision to equip a particular fighter jet with GPWS depends on several factors, such as the aircraft's design, mission profile, and the specific requirements of the air force that operates it.

GPWS is a safety system that provides pilots with warnings when the aircraft is flying too close to the ground or other obstacles. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, to measure the aircraft's altitude and ground clearance. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will issue a series of audible and visual warnings to the pilots.

GPWS is a valuable safety feature that can help to prevent accidents. However, it is important to note that the system is not foolproof. It is still possible for pilots to fly into the ground even if their aircraft is equipped with GPWS. This is why it is important for pilots to be aware of the limitations of GPWS and to use it in conjunction with other safety measures, such as visual scanning and terrain awareness systems.

Here are some examples of fighter jets that are equipped with GPWS:

* F-16 Fighting Falcon
* F/A-18 Hornet
* Eurofighter Typhoon
* Rafale
* F-35 Lightning II
