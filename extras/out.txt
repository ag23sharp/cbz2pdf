Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed as standard equipment. GPWS is a vital safety system that provides pilots with audible and visual alerts when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground. This helps to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which can occur when a pilot is unaware of their altitude and position relative to the ground.

GPWS uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's height above the ground. When the aircraft is at a low altitude, GPWS will activate and provide the pilot with warnings such as "Terrain, terrain" or "Pull up." The warnings become more frequent and urgent as the aircraft gets closer to the ground.

GPWS has been credited with saving many lives since it was first introduced in the 1970s. It is now considered to be an essential safety feature on all modern aircraft, including fighter jets.
