Yes, fighter jets typically have a form of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. The specific type and functionality may vary depending on the aircraft type and the manufacturer, but GPWS is generally an essential safety feature for fighter jets due to their high speeds and low-altitude operations.

GPWS in fighter jets provides several key functions:

1. Terrain Warning: GPWS uses radar altimeter data to detect when the aircraft is close to the ground, providing alerts to the pilot if the aircraft is at risk of impact.

2. Altitude Callouts: GPWS provides regular altitude callouts (e.g., "500 feet," "200 feet") to keep the pilot informed of their height above the terrain.

3. Windshear Detection: Some GPWS systems can detect windshear conditions and provide warnings to the pilot. Windshear can create sudden changes in wind speed and direction, which can be hazardous for aircraft during takeoff and landing.

4. Obstacle Warnings: GPWS can also detect obstacles (e.g., buildings, towers) in the vicinity of the aircraft and provide alerts to the pilot.

The GPWS in fighter jets is typically integrated with other safety systems, such as the flight control system and the autothrottle, to provide comprehensive protection and to prevent incidents such as controlled flight into terrain (CFIT).
