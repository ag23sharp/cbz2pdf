Yes, many modern fighter jets have a form of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. It is known as Terrain Awareness Warning System (TAWS) or Enhanced Ground Proximity Warning System (EGPWS) in fighter jets. These systems provide the pilot with timely warnings when the aircraft is approaching terrain or obstacles, helping to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. They integrate data from radar altimeters, inertial navigation systems, and terrain databases to provide alerts and guidance to the pilot.
