Yes, many modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots of potentially hazardous proximity to terrain or obstacles. It utilizes a combination of sensors, such as radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and airspeed sensors, to calculate the aircraft's altitude and closure rate with the ground. When the system detects a potential collision threat, it provides audible and visual warnings to the pilots, prompting them to take evasive action. GPWS is an essential safety feature that helps to reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, especially during low-altitude operations, instrument approaches, or in mountainous areas.
