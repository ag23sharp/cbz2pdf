Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. 

GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, helping to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, to determine the aircraft's altitude and distance from the ground. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the terrain, it will issue a series of warnings to the pilots, including visual and aural alerts, as well as autopilot disengagement.

GPWS is an important safety feature for fighter jets, as it can help to prevent accidents that may otherwise be fatal.
