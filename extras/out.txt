Most modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS), also known as Terrain Awareness and Warning Systems (TAWS). GPWS is a critical safety feature that provides pilots with visual and audible alerts when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles, helping to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.

GPWS uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters, inertial navigation systems, and terrain databases, to determine the aircraft's position and altitude relative to the surrounding terrain. When the system detects a potential conflict, it provides timely alerts to the pilots, allowing them to take corrective action to avoid a collision.

GPWS is particularly valuable in situations where the pilot's visibility is limited, such as during nighttime operations, in bad weather, or in mountainous terrain. It can also provide additional safety margins in low-altitude maneuvers, such as aerial refueling or bombing runs.

The capabilities and performance of GPWS systems can vary depending on the specific aircraft and the manufacturer's implementation. However, the overall purpose of GPWS is to enhance situational awareness and reduce the risk of CFIT accidents, making it an essential safety feature for modern fighter jets.
