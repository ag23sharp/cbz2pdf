Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a system that provides warnings to pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar, barometers, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's altitude and distance from the ground. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will issue a series of warnings to the pilot, including visual, audible, and tactile cues.
