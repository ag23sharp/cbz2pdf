Nokia is not considered to be particularly good in the current smartphone market. The company used to be a dominant player in the mobile phone industry, but has since lost market share to competitors such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Here are some reasons why Nokia is no longer considered to be so good:

* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been slow to adopt new technologies and features in its smartphones. The company's devices often lag behind the competition in terms of design, performance, and features.
* **High prices:** Nokia's smartphones are often priced higher than comparable devices from other brands. This makes it difficult for the company to compete in the mid-range and budget segments of the market.
* **Poor marketing:** Nokia has not done a good job of marketing its smartphones. The company's devices are often not well-known or advertised, which makes it difficult to generate interest and sales.
* **Competition from other brands:** The smartphone market is now dominated by a few large brands such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. These brands have a strong track record of innovation and marketing, which makes it difficult for Nokia to compete.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined significantly in recent years. The company is now a minor player in the smartphone market, and its devices are no longer considered to be particularly good.
