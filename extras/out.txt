Nokia is not as good as it used to be. In the early 2000s, Nokia was the dominant player in the mobile phone market, with over 50% of the global market share. However, the company failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the smartphone market, and its market share has since declined sharply. Today, Nokia is a minor player in the global smartphone market, with less than 1% market share.

There are several reasons why Nokia is no longer as good as it used to be. One reason is that the company failed to adapt to the changing needs of consumers. In the early days of the mobile phone market, consumers were primarily interested in basic features such as making calls and sending text messages. However, as smartphones became more popular, consumers began to demand more advanced features such as internet access, camera, and GPS. Nokia was slow to respond to these changing demands, and as a result, it lost market share to more innovative companies such as Apple and Samsung.

Another reason why Nokia is no longer as good as it used to be is that the company failed to invest in research and development. In the early 2000s, Nokia was a leader in mobile phone innovation. However, the company failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the smartphone market. As a result, Nokia's products became less competitive, and the company lost market share to more innovative companies such as Apple and Samsung.

Finally, Nokia's failure to adapt to the changing landscape of the mobile phone market was also due to its management. Nokia's management team was slow to make decisions, and it often failed to understand the needs of consumers. As a result, Nokia was unable to make the necessary changes to remain competitive in the smartphone market.

In conclusion, there are several reasons why Nokia is no longer as good as it used to be. The company failed to adapt to the changing needs of consumers, it failed to invest in research and development, and its management team was slow to make decisions. As a result, Nokia lost market share to more innovative companies such as Apple and Samsung.
