Nokia has been good at making and selling mobile phones in the past. However, in recent years, its market share has declined and it is no longer a major player in the mobile phone industry.

There are several reasons for Nokia's decline:

* **Competition from other mobile phone manufacturers:** Samsung, Apple, and Huawei have all released popular and well-received mobile phones that have attracted consumers away from Nokia.
* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has not been as quick as its competitors to adopt new technologies and features in its mobile phones. This has made its phones less appealing to consumers.
* **Problems with its operating system:** Nokia's Symbian operating system has been criticized for being outdated and not as user-friendly as other mobile operating systems.
* **Financial problems:** Nokia has faced financial problems in recent years, which has limited its ability to invest in new products and marketing.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined and it is no longer a major player in the mobile phone industry.
