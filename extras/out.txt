Yes, most modern fighter jets have some form of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to pilots when the aircraft is at a low altitude and in close proximity to the ground. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, GPS, and inertial navigation systems, to determine the aircraft's altitude and position relative to the ground. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will provide warnings to the pilots, such as visual and aural alerts.
