Nokia was once a leading mobile phone manufacturer, but its market share has declined in recent years. There are several reasons for this, including:

* **Competition from other manufacturers.** Samsung, Apple, and Huawei have all released popular smartphones that have eaten into Nokia's market share.
* **Lack of innovation.** Nokia has been slow to innovate in recent years, and its phones have not been able to keep up with the latest trends.
* **Poor marketing.** Nokia's marketing has not been as effective as that of its competitors, and the company has not been able to generate excitement for its products.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined in recent years. The company is now a much smaller player in the mobile phone market than it once was.
