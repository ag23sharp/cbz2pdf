Yes, some fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or another obstacle. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar, barometric altimeters, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's altitude and position relative to the ground. When the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will issue a series of warnings to the pilots, including visual and aural alerts. GPWS is a valuable safety system that has helped to prevent many accidents.
