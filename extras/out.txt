Nokia was once a leading mobile phone manufacturer, known for its durability, reliability, and ease of use. However, the company has faced significant challenges in recent years, losing market share to competitors such as Samsung and Apple.

Here are some of the reasons why Nokia was once considered so good:

* **Durability:** Nokia phones were renowned for their ruggedness and ability to withstand drops and other accidents. This was due to the use of high-quality materials and solid construction.
* **Reliability:** Nokia phones were also known for their reliability. They were less likely to experience software glitches or hardware failures than many competing devices.
* **Ease of use:** Nokia phones were designed with simplicity in mind, making them easy to navigate and use, even for those who were not tech-savvy.
* **Battery life:** Nokia phones were known for their long battery life, allowing users to go for extended periods without having to recharge.
* **Brand recognition:** Nokia was a well-established brand with a strong reputation for quality and reliability. This made their phones attractive to consumers who were looking for a dependable device.

However, Nokia's dominance in the mobile phone market declined in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The company failed to keep up with the rapid pace of innovation in the industry, and its devices were seen as outdated and overpriced compared to those of its competitors.

In 2014, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft, which attempted to revive the brand but ultimately failed. In 2017, HMD Global, a Finnish company, acquired the rights to the Nokia brand and has since released a number of new Nokia-branded smartphones. However, these devices have not been able to recapture the success of the company's earlier products.
