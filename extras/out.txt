Yes, most modern fighter jets have some form of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed.

GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots when their aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. It uses various sensors, such as radar altimeters, inertial navigation systems, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's position and altitude relative to the terrain.

When the GPWS detects that the aircraft is in potential danger of colliding with the ground, it provides audible and visual warnings to the pilots. The warnings can include aural alerts, such as "pull up" or "terrain," as well as visual cues on the aircraft's display.

The specific implementation of GPWS can vary between different fighter jet models and manufacturers. However, all modern fighter jets are designed with the goal of enhancing safety and reducing the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.
