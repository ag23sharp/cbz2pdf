Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides alerts to pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, water, or other obstacles. The system uses a variety of sensors to detect the aircraft's altitude, ground speed, and rate of descent, and provides audio and visual warnings to the pilots if the aircraft is approaching a hazardous situation. GPWS is a valuable safety feature that helps to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are often caused by pilot error or disorientation.
