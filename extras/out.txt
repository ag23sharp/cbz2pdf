Yes, some fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a cockpit warning system that provides alerts to pilots when they are flying too close to the ground or obstacles, helping to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.

GPWS typically uses a combination of radar, barometric altitude, and terrain data to detect potential hazards. When the system detects a potential conflict with the ground or an obstacle, it provides visual and aural warnings to the pilots, such as "Terrain, terrain," "Pull up," or "Bank angle."

Not all fighter jets have GPWS installed, as it can add weight and complexity to the aircraft. However, many modern fighter jets, especially those designed for low-altitude operations, are equipped with GPWS or similar terrain awareness systems.

Examples of fighter jets with GPWS include:

* F-16 Fighting Falcon
* F-35 Lightning II
* Eurofighter Typhoon
* Dassault Rafale
* Saab Gripen
* Sukhoi Su-35 Flanker

The presence of GPWS in fighter jets helps to enhance safety and reduce the risk of CFIT accidents, which can be catastrophic for both the pilots and the aircraft.
