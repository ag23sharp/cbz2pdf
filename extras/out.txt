Yes, fighter jets typically have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots when they are in close proximity to the ground or obstacles. It uses radar or other sensors to measure the aircraft's altitude and speed, and compares this data to a stored database of terrain and obstacle information. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will issue a warning to the pilots. GPWS is an important safety feature that can help prevent accidents, especially in low-visibility conditions or when operating at low altitudes.
