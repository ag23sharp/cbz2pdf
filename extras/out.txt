Yes, many modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a cockpit warning system designed to alert the pilot when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles, thereby reducing the risk of a controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accident. The system uses a combination of radar altimeters, accelerometers, and other sensors to monitor the aircraft's altitude and trajectory relative to the surrounding terrain. When the system detects a potential hazard, it provides a series of audible and visual warnings to the pilot, urging them to take corrective action.
