Yes, most modern fighter jets have a version of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. This system provides alerts to the pilot when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground and other obstacles. The GPWS in fighter jets is typically integrated with other safety systems, such as terrain awareness and warning systems (TAWS) and flight control systems, to enhance situational awareness and prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.
