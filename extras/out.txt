Nokia was once a leading mobile phone manufacturer, but its market share has declined significantly in recent years. There are a number of reasons for this, including:

* **Competition from other manufacturers:** Samsung, Apple, and Huawei have all become major players in the mobile phone market, and they offer a wider range of products at a variety of price points.
* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been slow to innovate in recent years, and its phones have not always kept up with the latest trends.
* **Poor marketing:** Nokia has not been effective in marketing its products, and its brand has suffered as a result.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined from over 50% in 2007 to just 3% in 2019. The company is now focusing on niche markets, such as feature phones and mobile networks.
