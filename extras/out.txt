Nokia's reputation for quality and durability was established during its early years as a paper mill and rubber manufacturer. The company's focus on innovation and durability extended to its mobile phone division, which quickly gained a reputation for producing reliable and long-lasting devices.

Here are some of the factors that have contributed to Nokia's strong reputation:

* **High-quality materials:** Nokia phones are typically made from premium materials, such as metal and glass, which contribute to their durability and longevity.
* **Rigorous testing:** Nokia phones undergo rigorous testing before they are released to the market, ensuring that they can withstand a variety of conditions, including extreme temperatures, humidity, and dust.
* **Excellent customer service:** Nokia provides excellent customer service, including a comprehensive warranty and a dedicated support team. This gives customers peace of mind and helps to ensure that their devices will be repaired or replaced quickly if necessary.

While Nokia's market share has declined in recent years due to competition from newer brands, the company's reputation for quality remains strong. Nokia phones are still seen as a good value for the money, and many customers continue to buy them because they know they can rely on them.
