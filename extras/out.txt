Yes, most modern fighter jets have a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a system that provides auditory and visual warnings to pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. This system is designed to help prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are often caused by pilots losing situational awareness or becoming disoriented during flight.
