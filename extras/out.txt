Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to pilots when the aircraft is approaching the ground or other obstacles, and also when the aircraft's flight path is too steep or low.

GPWS uses a variety of sensors to determine the aircraft's altitude, ground speed, and flight path angle. When the aircraft gets too close to the ground or an obstacle, the GPWS system will issue a warning to the pilot. The warning may be aural, visual, or both.

GPWS is an important safety system that has helped to prevent many accidents. It is a standard feature on most modern fighter jets and airliners.
