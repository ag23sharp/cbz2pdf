Tails (The Amnesic Incognito Live System) is a live operating system that aims to protect user privacy and anonymity. It is based on Debian Linux and is designed to be run from a USB drive or DVD.

Tails includes a number of features that help to protect user privacy, including:

* **Tor:** Tails uses Tor to encrypt all of its network traffic, making it difficult for anyone to track the user's online activities.
* **Amnesia:** Tails is designed to leave no trace of the user's activities on the computer. When the user shuts down Tails, all of the data that was created during the session is deleted.
* **Privacy-focused tools:** Tails includes a number of privacy-focused tools, such as a web browser with built-in privacy features, a password manager, and a file encryption tool.

Tails is a powerful tool for protecting user privacy and anonymity. It is a good choice for anyone who is concerned about their online privacy or who needs to protect their data from surveillance or censorship.
