Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides audible and visual warnings to pilots when the aircraft is approaching the ground or obstacles. It helps to prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are often fatal.

GPWS uses a variety of sensors, including radar, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to determine the aircraft's altitude, ground speed, and flight path. When the system detects that the aircraft is approaching the ground or an obstacle, it will issue a warning to the pilot. The warning will typically include an audible tone, a visual display, and a voice message.

GPWS has been credited with saving many lives, and it is now considered to be an essential safety feature for all modern aircraft.
