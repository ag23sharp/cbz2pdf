Nokia is not generally considered to be as good as it once was. In the early 2000s, Nokia was the dominant mobile phone manufacturer, with a market share of over 50%. However, the company began to decline in the late 2000s, as it failed to keep up with the competition from Apple and Samsung. Nokia's market share has since fallen to less than 10%.

There are several reasons why Nokia is no longer considered to be as good as it once was. First, the company has been slow to innovate. Nokia's phones have often been behind the competition in terms of features and design. Second, Nokia has been plagued by quality problems. Its phones have been known to be unreliable and prone to breaking. Third, Nokia has been slow to respond to the changing market. The company has been slow to adopt new technologies, such as smartphones and 4G LTE networks.

As a result of these problems, Nokia has lost market share to its competitors. Apple and Samsung are now the leading mobile phone manufacturers, and Nokia is no longer a major player in the market.
