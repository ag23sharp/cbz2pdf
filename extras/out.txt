Yes, fighter jets typically have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a cockpit warning system designed to alert pilots when their aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. It uses a combination of sensors, including radar, barometric altimeters, and GPS, to monitor the aircraft's altitude, position, and rate of descent. If the system detects that the aircraft is approaching a hazardous situation, it will issue a warning to the pilots through visual and audible alerts. GPWS has been credited with saving many lives by helping pilots to avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.
