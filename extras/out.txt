Yes, many modern fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). GPWS is a safety system that provides the pilot with audible and visual warnings when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. It uses a combination of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to calculate the aircraft's altitude and distance from the ground. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will issue a warning to the pilot. GPWS is a vital safety feature that has helped to prevent many accidents and save lives.
