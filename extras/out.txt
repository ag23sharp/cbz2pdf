Yes, most modern fighter jets are equipped with a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS). GPWS is a system that provides warnings to the pilot when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. The system uses a variety of sensors, including radar, barometric altimeters, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's position and altitude. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground or another obstacle, it will issue a warning to the pilot. The warning may be visual, aural, or both.
