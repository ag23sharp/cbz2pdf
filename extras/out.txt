Nokia was once a leading mobile phone manufacturer, known for its durability, reliability, and user-friendly devices. However, it has lost its market share in recent years due to competition from other manufacturers. Here are some of the reasons why Nokia used to be so good:

**1. Durability:** Nokia phones were renowned for their ruggedness and durability. They were often made of high-quality materials, such as metal and polycarbonate, and could withstand drops, bumps, and spills. This made them popular with people who needed a phone that could withstand the rigors of everyday use.

**2. Reliability:** Nokia phones were also known for their reliability. They were well-built and less likely to experience software or hardware problems. This made them a good choice for people who needed a phone that they could count on to work when they needed it.

**3. User-friendly:** Nokia phones were designed to be easy to use. They featured simple and intuitive interfaces that made them accessible to people of all ages and technical abilities. This made them popular with a wide range of consumers.

**4. Innovation:** Nokia was once a pioneer in the mobile phone industry. It was responsible for a number of innovations, such as the first mobile phone with a built-in camera and the first smartphone with a touch screen. This helped Nokia to maintain its leadership position in the market for many years.

**5. Brand reputation:** Nokia had a strong brand reputation for quality and reliability. This was built up over many years of producing high-quality products and providing good customer service. This reputation helped Nokia to attract and retain customers, even as the competition increased in the mobile phone market.

However, Nokia has struggled to maintain its market share in recent years. It has been outpaced by other manufacturers, such as Samsung and Apple, which have produced more innovative and feature-rich smartphones. Nokia has also been slow to adopt new technologies, such as 4G and 5G networks. As a result, it has lost its position as the leading mobile phone manufacturer and is now a minor player in the market.
