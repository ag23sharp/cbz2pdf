Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides alerts to pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. It uses sensors to measure the aircraft's altitude and rate of descent, and provides visual and aural warnings to the pilots if the aircraft is in danger of impact. GPWS is an important safety feature that helps to reduce the risk of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are often caused by pilot error or disorientation.
