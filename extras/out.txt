Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides alerts to the pilot when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground, obstacles, or other potential hazards. It is designed to help prevent controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) and other accidents.

GPWS typically uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to provide the pilot with information about the aircraft's altitude, ground speed, and rate of descent. When the system detects that the aircraft is in a potentially hazardous situation, it will issue a series of audible and visual warnings to the pilot, such as a "terrain, terrain, pull up" warning.

GPWS is a valuable safety feature that can help to prevent accidents and save lives. It is one of many systems that are used in modern fighter jets to enhance safety and situational awareness for the pilot.
