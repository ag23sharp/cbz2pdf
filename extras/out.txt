Yes, most modern fighter jets have some form of Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a system that alerts pilots to potential hazards during low-altitude flight, such as terrain, obstacles, and other aircraft. It uses a combination of radar, altitude measurements, and terrain databases to provide warnings to the pilot in a timely manner. Some fighter jets may have more advanced versions of GPWS, such as Terrain Awareness and Warning System (TAWS), which provide additional information and warnings to help pilots avoid controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents.
