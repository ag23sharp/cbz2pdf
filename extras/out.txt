Yes, most modern fighter jets have a Ground Proximity Warning System (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides warnings to the pilot when the aircraft is approaching the ground or other obstacles. The system uses radar and other sensors to measure the aircraft's altitude, speed, and rate of descent. If the system detects that the aircraft is in danger of colliding with the ground, it will issue an audible and visual warning to the pilot. GPWS has been credited with saving many lives by preventing aircraft from crashing into the ground.
