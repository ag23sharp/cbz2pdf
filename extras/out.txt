Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system designed to alert pilots to potential collisions with the ground or other obstacles. It uses a variety of sensors to determine the aircraft's altitude, speed, and proximity to the ground, and provides warnings to the pilot if there is a risk of collision. GPWS is an important safety feature that has helped to prevent many accidents.
