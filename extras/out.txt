**Tails OS (The Amnesic Incognito Live System)** is a privacy-focused Linux distribution designed to protect users' anonymity and security.

**Features:**

* **Live Boot:** Tails runs entirely from a bootable USB drive or DVD, leaving no trace on the host system.
* **Tor Integration:** All internet traffic is routed through the Tor network for anonymity.
* **Encrypted Filesystem:** The entire Tails filesystem is encrypted by default, protecting user data from unauthorized access.
* **Amnesia:** After each reboot, Tails forgets all user settings and activity, protecting against persistent surveillance.
* **Privacy Tools:** Tails includes a suite of privacy tools for secure browsing, file encryption, and anonymity.

**Use Cases:**

Tails is particularly useful for individuals who need to:

* Protect their online privacy from government surveillance or censorship.
* Hide their IP address and location when accessing sensitive information.
* Securely communicate with others through encrypted messaging or whistleblowing platforms.
* Bypass internet filtering or censorship in restrictive environments.
* Protect their data from compromise in public Wi-Fi hotspots or shared computers.

**Limitations:**

* Tails is not a full-fledged operating system and cannot be installed on a hard drive.
* It relies on the Tor network for anonymity, which can be slow or unreliable in some situations.
* It may not be compatible with all hardware or software.

**Security Considerations:**

Tails is highly secure, but it's important to note that it cannot guarantee complete anonymity or protection from all surveillance:

* Law enforcement or intelligence agencies with advanced resources may be able to de-anonymize users in certain cases.
* Physical access to a Tails system can compromise the user's security.
* Users should be aware of potential threats and take additional precautions, such as using encrypted messaging services and being mindful of their online behavior.
