Nokia was once the leading mobile phone manufacturer in the world, known for its durability, reliability, and user-friendliness. However, in recent years, the company has lost market share to other brands, such as Samsung and Apple.

Here are some reasons why Nokia was so good:

* **Durability:** Nokia phones were known for their ruggedness and durability. They were made from high-quality materials and could withstand being dropped or knocked around.
* **Reliability:** Nokia phones were also known for their reliability. They were less likely to break down or malfunction than other brands.
* **User-friendliness:** Nokia phones were easy to use, even for people who were not familiar with technology. They had simple menus and intuitive controls.
* **Battery life:** Nokia phones had long battery lives, which meant that users could use them for extended periods of time without having to recharge them.
* **Innovation:** Nokia was a pioneer in the mobile phone industry. It was the first company to introduce several key features, such as the camera phone and the smartphone.

In recent years, Nokia has lost market share to other brands, such as Samsung and Apple. This is due to a number of factors, including:

* **Competition:** Nokia has faced increasing competition from other brands, such as Samsung and Apple. These brands have invested heavily in marketing and innovation, and they have been able to attract customers with their sleek designs and powerful features.
* **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been slow to innovate in recent years. The company has not been able to keep up with the latest trends in the mobile phone industry, and it has failed to introduce any groundbreaking new features.
* **Poor marketing:** Nokia has also been criticized for its poor marketing. The company has not been able to effectively communicate its value proposition to consumers, and it has failed to build a strong brand identity.

As a result of these factors, Nokia has lost market share to other brands. The company is now a minor player in the mobile phone industry, and it is unclear whether it will be able to regain its former glory.
