Nokia is no longer a top player in the smartphone market, but it used to be a dominant force in the industry for many years. There were several reasons for Nokia's success:

* **Early leadership:** Nokia was one of the pioneers in the mobile phone industry, and it established itself as a leader in the early days of the market. This gave Nokia a strong foundation and a loyal customer base.
* **Strong brand:** Nokia built a strong brand reputation for reliability, durability, and ease of use. Nokia phones were known for their sturdy construction and long battery life, which made them popular with consumers.
* **Innovative products:** Nokia was known for its innovative products, such as the first mobile phone with a built-in camera and the first smartphone with a touch screen. These innovations helped Nokia stay ahead of the competition and attract new customers.
* **Global reach:** Nokia had a strong global presence, and it was able to market its products in a wide range of countries. This gave Nokia a significant advantage over its competitors, who were often focused on only a few markets.

However, Nokia's dominance in the mobile phone market began to decline in the late 2000s and early 2010s. The company failed to adapt to the changing market conditions, such as the rise of smartphones and the increasing popularity of Android and iOS. As a result, Nokia's market share declined, and it was eventually acquired by Microsoft in 2014.
