Nokia was once a leading mobile phone manufacturer, known for its durability, reliability, and innovative designs. However, in recent years, Nokia's market share has declined due to competition from other manufacturers, such as Samsung and Apple.

Here are some of the reasons why Nokia was so good:

* **Durability:** Nokia phones were known for their rugged construction and ability to withstand drops and other accidents. This made them popular with people who needed a phone that could handle the rigors of everyday life.
* **Reliability:** Nokia phones were also known for their reliability. They were less likely to break down or experience software problems than phones from other manufacturers. This made them a good choice for people who needed a phone that they could count on.
* **Innovative designs:** Nokia was also known for its innovative designs. The company was the first to introduce many features that became standard on mobile phones, such as the built-in camera and the color screen.

However, Nokia's success began to decline in the late 2000s as other manufacturers, such as Samsung and Apple, began to release more innovative and feature-rich phones. Nokia was slow to adapt to the changing market, and its market share began to decline.

In 2014, Nokia sold its mobile phone business to Microsoft. Microsoft continued to produce Nokia-branded phones, but these phones were not as successful as the phones that Nokia had produced in the past.

In 2017, HMD Global, a Finnish company, acquired the rights to the Nokia brand. HMD Global has since released a number of new Nokia-branded phones that have been well-received by critics. However, it remains to be seen whether HMD Global can restore Nokia to its former glory.
