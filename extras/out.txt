Yes, many modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a safety system that provides pilots with alerts and warnings when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. It uses a combination of sensors, including radar, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to determine the aircraft's position and altitude relative to the terrain. GPWS can provide warnings through visual displays, audible alerts, or both, depending on the specific system installed.
