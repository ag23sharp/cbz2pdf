Nokia is not necessarily considered a "good" brand in the smartphone market anymore. In the past, Nokia was known for its durability and reliability. However, in recent years, the company has struggled to keep up with the competition from other manufacturers such as Apple, Samsung, and Huawei. Here are some reasons why Nokia's reputation has declined:

1. **Lack of innovation:** Nokia has been slow to adopt new technologies and features in its smartphones. This has made their devices seem outdated compared to the competition.
2. **Poor software support:** Nokia's smartphones have often been criticized for their lack of software updates. This can leave users with security vulnerabilities and other issues.
3. **Limited app availability:** Nokia's app store is not as extensive as those of other manufacturers. This can make it difficult for users to find the apps they want.
4. **Weak marketing:** Nokia has not been able to effectively market its smartphones in recent years. This has led to a decline in brand awareness and sales.

As a result of these factors, Nokia's market share has declined significantly in recent years. The company is no longer considered a major player in the smartphone market.

However, it's worth noting that Nokia has recently made some changes in an effort to improve its position in the market. The company has partnered with Google to release a new line of Android smartphones. These devices have been well-received by critics and consumers alike. It remains to be seen whether Nokia can regain its former glory, but the company is certainly moving in the right direction.
