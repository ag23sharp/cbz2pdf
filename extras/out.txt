Yes, most modern fighter jets have Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS) installed. GPWS is a vital safety feature that alerts pilots to potential collisions with terrain and obstacles during low-altitude flight. It uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometers, and GPS, to determine the aircraft's altitude and proximity to the ground. If the system detects a potential threat, it will issue audible and visual warnings to the pilots, giving them time to take corrective action. GPWS has proven to be highly effective in reducing the incidence of controlled flight into terrain (CFIT) accidents, which are among the leading causes of aviation fatalities.
