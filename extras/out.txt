Yes, some fighter jets are equipped with Ground Proximity Warning Systems (GPWS). 

GPWS is a safety system that provides visual and aural warnings to pilots when the aircraft is in close proximity to the ground or other obstacles. 

It uses a variety of sensors, including radar altimeters, barometric altimeters, and inertial navigation systems, to determine the aircraft's height above the ground and its rate of descent. 

When the system detects that the aircraft is approaching dangerous terrain, it alerts the pilots with warnings such as "Terrain, terrain," "Pull up," or "Bank angle." 

GPWS is a vital safety feature that has helped to prevent numerous accidents and fatalities in both civil and military aviation.
